    multi_os - an example script that runs on linux, MacOS, and Windows.

    multi_os is an example of how to write a script that will run on different
    operating systems.  It uses the lua-scripts libraries to lessen the amount
    of code that needs to be written, as well as gaining access to tested 
    cross-platform routines.  This script also performs a function that some 
    may find useful.  It creates a button in the lighttable selected images module
    that extracts the embedded jpeg image from a raw file, then imports it and groups
    it with the raw file.  A keyboard shortcut is also created.  A key combination can
    be assigned to the shortcut in the lua preferences and then the action can be invoked
    by hovering over the image and pressing the key combination.

    ADDITIONAL SOFTWARE NEEDED FOR THIS SCRIPT
    * ufraw-batch - https://ufraw.sourceforge.net
                    MacOS - install with homebrew

    USAGE
    * require this script from your main lua file
    * start darktable, open prefreences, go to lua options 
      and update the executable location if you are running
      Windows or MacOS, then restart darktable.
    * select an image or images
    * click the button to extract the jpeg

    BUGS, COMMENTS, SUGGESTIONS
    * Send to Bill Ferguson, wpferguson@gmail.com

    Windows and MacOS don't place executables in the user's path so their location needs to be specified
