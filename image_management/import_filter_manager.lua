IMPORT FILTER MANAGER
This script adds a dropdown list with import filters to the import dialog.
Scripts can add new filters by registering them with
  darktable.register_import_filter(name, callback)
The callback has type function(event, images), i.e., it is the same as when
directly registering the pre-import event.


USAGE
* require this script from your main lua file
* also require some files with import filters, for example import_filters.lua.
  it is important to add them AFTER this one!
