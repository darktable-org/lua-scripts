EXAMPLE IMPORT FILTERS
This script goes along with the import filter manager. It adds two filters:
* ignore jpegs: this one does the same as the existing option in the import dialog
                and just skips all JPEGs during import.
* prefer raw over jpeg: this one is a bit more elaborate, it ignores JPEGs when there
                        is also another file with the same basename, otherwise it
                        allows JPEGs, too.

USAGE
* require this script from your main lua file AFTER import_filter_manager.lua
